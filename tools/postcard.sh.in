Please send the developers an postcard!

And finally we are coming to the fun part. AS it is the only compensation that
developers of this lousy software get - AfterStep will automagically e-mail a
single message anytime ~/.afterstep directory needs to be rebuilt. This message
will contain such a vital information as date, time, your X server color depth,
number of X screens, number of xinerama screens, compiler version, kernel
version, and list of linked to libraries.

If you object to this e-mailing activity, simply deny it below.

That is all! We will go back to your regular programming now.

Oh, almost forgot - enjoy your eyecandy :)
