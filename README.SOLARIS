Note for Solaris users:

AfterStep builds and runs on (at least) the versions of Solaris listed
below.  In each section the OS version is accompanied by the appropriate
notes.

--------------------------------------------------------------

        Solaris 2.5.1 with SunPro C 4.2 or gcc 2.7.2
        Solaris 2.4 with IXI Motif and SunPro C 3.0.1

It ought to build on Solaris 2.4 with normal OpenWindows too.

There may be problems running some parts of AfterStep on 8bpp screens; these
are not problems with Solaris per se - they affect all platforms.

You should edit configure.h so that XPMLIBRARY contains the linker
options needed to link with the Xpm library. In our systems here, libXpm.so
is installed in /usr/local/lib, so I have:

        #define XPMLIBRARY -L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib -lXpm

(If you don't know what -L or -R do, read the man page for ld.)

Whilst you are editing the configure.h file remember to change all the
references to /usr/X11R6 to somewhere suitable for your machine.

When you come to the final "make" which compiles everything, you will probably
have to do something which tells the compiler where to find the Xpm header
file (xpm.h). You should do this by defining the CDEBUGFLAGS macro on make's
command line. Because xpm.h is installed on our network in
/usr/local/include/X11, I do this:

        make CDEBUGFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include

A correctly configured imake should define SYSV and SVR4 in the Makefiles. If
it doesn't (and IXI's imake doesn't) you will need to add them to the
CDEBUGFLAGS macro as well. Something like:

        make "CDEBUGFLAGS=-DSYSV -I/opt/IXI/X11 -I/opt/IXI/include"

[If anyone has other broken versions of imake please email the afterstep
maintainers so it can be mentioned here. Thanks!]

	Solaris 9 update 4 with gcc 2.8.1

1. Before running configure you need to

  a) (OPTIONAL) install the Fast Light Toolkit, fltk.  This is available as
  a freeware package from Sun; search for the package name "SFWfltk" at
  www.sun.com.

  b) edit the configure script, replacing

    LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -rdynamic"

  with

    LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -R/usr/sfw/lib"

2. Run configure as

  % ./configure --prefix=/opt/sfw

3. If you are using an old version of gcc, remove "-fpermissive" from
   INCS_PRIVATE in src/ascp/Makefile.  (This is apparently needed for more
   recent versions of gcc.)

4. Go ahead, build and install.
