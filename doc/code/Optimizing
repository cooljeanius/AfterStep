How can you optimise your code ?

* First, you must recompile AfterStep with gcc & add "-pg" to CFLAGS.
  This can easily be done by ./configure --enable-gprof.

* Then run AfterStep as usal, try as many thing as you can.

* Finally, when you exit, a file gmon.out is created : copy afterstep
  binary to current dir/a.out, and run gprof, or run gprof afterstep.

The percentages represent CPU time spent is functions : optimize the most
called ones !
