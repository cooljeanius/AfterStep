TODO:
        Common :
                1. Update man pages to reflect changes in config options.
                2. Design better default looks and module config.
                3. Convert icons to PNG format, and include png library.
                   If we use XCF format here - we would not need any additional libraries,
                   but it is not as widespread as PNG, and certainly is not standardized.
                4. Create separate package with XPM icons for those who live in the past.
                5. Add 8 bit alpha channel to all icons to take advantage of new renedring
                   capabilities.
                6. Possibly supply some TTF fonts ???
                7. Take some sweet screenshots reflecting new features, and post them on the
                   web.
                8. Update websites afterstep.sf.net and maybe www.afterstep.org (see David Mihm).
        AfterStep-proper :
                1. Debug stacking order between layers
                2. Implement support for background image description in asetroot file
                   (when look does not have it).
                3. Implement theme handling tool.
                4. Implement support for cursor movement using the keyboard while in menus.
                5. Add FollowTitleChanges option to the database flags.
        asetroot :
                1. Move background handling code into the lib from afterstep-proper/pager.c.
                2. Change to use above-mentioned code
                3. Add notice that it could only be used with -l options and for single desktop -
                   background changing should be handled by afterstep-proper from now on.
        Animate
                1. Update to include support for new module code in the lib.
        Audio
                1. Update to include support for new module code in the lib.
                2. Possible backport main code from afterstep-devel
        Banner
                1. Update to include support for new module code in the lib.
                2. Take advantage of libAfterImage to support more image formats
        Cascade
                1. Update to include support for new module code in the lib.
                2. Merge with Tile into Arrange module - they share 90% code at the moment.
        Clean
                1. Update to include support for new module code in the lib.
        Form
                1. Update to include support for new module code in the lib.
                2. We should seriously consider scrapping the whole thing off, as
                   maintaining yet another library of widgets is the pain in the ass.
                   Otherwise we should probably convert it to use QT/GTK instead.
        Gnome
                1. I do not see any reason for this one to exists, since afterstep-proper
                   is supposed to provide 100% GNOME compatibility - investigate.
        Ident
                1. Update to include support for new module code in the lib.
        Pager
                1. Once iconic windows are implemented in afterstep-proper - debug iconinc
                   Pager, as well as switching between Iconic and Normal state.
                2. Implement proper shaping when shaped texture type is used for background.
                   See Wharf for example.
        Save
                1. Update to include support for new module code in the lib.
        Script
                1. Update to include support for new module code in the lib.
                2. See TODO for Form. At the time I do not see any reason for Script
                   to exists at all.
        Scroll
                1. Update to include support for new module code in the lib.
        Sound
                1. Merge with Audio - they do exact same thing - see Audio in afterstep-devel.
        test
                1. feel free to use it for any testing :)
        Tile
                1. See Cascade.
        WinList
                1. Get rid of - WinList2 should be used instead.
        Wharf
                1. Implement Drag-N-Drop interface - need to check latest developments in GNOME
                   and use same approach as they do. See afterstep-devel for some code.
        Zharf
                1. Get rid of. Wharf can now do labels and more. Probably just create link to Wharf
                   for old times sake.

DONE:
        AfterStep-proper :
                1. Implement proper window switching using the keyboard ( aka Alt+Tabbing )
                2. MyFrames are now implemented and feature numerous powerfull features for
                   managing widow decoration, including titlebar bevel and align, different MyStyles
                   for titlebar and frame, scaling or tiling images, etc.
                3. Complete support for iconified windows
                4. Implement window placement  in arbitrary position when NoPPosition is used.
                5. Reimplement balloons.
        WinList2
                1. Implement all the config options support.
        Wharf
                1. Reimplement 2D layout where 2 rows of buttons could be displayed.
