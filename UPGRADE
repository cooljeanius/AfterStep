///     This is AfterStep UPGRADE
///

Upgrading to 2.x from 1.8.x for the impatient:

If you have an old configuration that you really like, and want to
keep, then the essential thing to know is that old configuration can
be copied from your old ~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep directory into
the new ~/.afterstep/ directory structure.  THIS IS LIKELY NOT TO
WORK PERFECTLY.  IT IS UNSUPPORTED, but it might get you started.  If
you ask on the list, you are likely to get some hints about what is
wrong; but you should not expect your old configuration just to work.

Overall, feels are most likely to work, looks are likely to break
slightly, and Wharf configuration is most likely to break.  Depending
on how annoying this is to you, you should use some of the sample
configurations as a model for making your new installation work.

Note that using old configuration files makes you miss out on the
nifty new features of the 2.x series.  For instance, antialiasing is
now supported, so it is likely you will want to alter your looks to
take advantage of this.  For all the gory details, see the other doc
files.  This file is for the impatient.  It doesn't have all the
details.
