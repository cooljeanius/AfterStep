Hi !

1. Description

This is the new AfterStep configuration interface.

1. Why ?

Since I haven't heard of ascp for a long time, I think it's a dead project.
Therefore, I started working on asconf concept (since AS 1.4.0).

2. How is it done ?

It was supposed to be in GTK, but once I discovered script, a superb GPL
scripting language, which made me stop the first asconf tryout for portability
reasons.
Basically, it's a port of script from Frédéric Lecordier, with some goodies
added for AfterStep.

3. Great ! Lemme play with it !

Now it's quite usable BUT IT IS NOT READY yet !
To see what it looks like, try Samples/DeskSetup.jpg.

4. When will it be ready ?

I'm spending many time on this project.
My first concern is usability, i.e. avoid hangups, crashes (...) which is now
quite good (afscript included in AS 1.5pre3 wasn't that good)
Then I have to introduce AS specific functions (see TODO) to ease script
creation.
And maybe code a GUI builder if I can't find any on internet.

So you see, there's still a lot of work.

But asconf will be present in AS 1.5 to configure everything but look (kinda
hard for now)

5. That's all !

Now I'm going to improve afscript & make some scripts to configure AfterStep
:-)

Have fun !
