<para>When client window is mapped on screen - Window Manager draws some frame decorations around it, such as Titlebar, 
resize handles, etc. As such decorations take additional space, it is nesseccary to specify if resulting larger window should be 
moved on screen in any particular direction in order to compensate for discrepancy in size. This is determined by Gravity hint.

Usually Gravity is set by client itself, depending on geometry specified by the user. 
For example geometry -10+100 will set gravity to NorthEast, while +10+100 will set gravity to NorthWest.
Sometimes this gravity setting requested by application is incorrect though, due to longstanding tradition of misinterpretation of its meaning.
In this cases it may be desired to override gravity. AfterStep users can accomplish that using database file, and definig new Style
for specific application with Gravity attribute set. For example it is recommended to set gravity of popular image viewver XV to be Static, 
as it tends to move self assuming that it knows everything.
