		<para>Windows will be tiled in free space. If no space of suitable size is found, 
then secondary placement strategy is engaged, or window will have to be placed manually. 
This is similar to SmartPlacement, except that suitable space is chosen following direction left-to-right, top-to-bottom, 
instead of looking for space, most fitting the window size (the way SmartPlacement works).</para>
