<varlistentry id="options.Function">
<term>Function <emphasis remap='I'>"function_name"</emphasis></term>
<listitem>
<para>There are also two situations where this might occur as well; as a function
definition stanza, or in calling a previously defined function decleration.</para>

<literallayout remap='.nf'>
Function <emphasis remap='I'>"function_name"</emphasis>
    built-in_file <command>"action"</command> [<emphasis remap='I'>argument</emphasis>]
EndFunction
</literallayout>

<para>Specifies the definition of a complex function <emphasis remap='I'>"function_name"</emphasis>,
which can later be bound to a mouse button or key using
<emphasis remap='I'>"function_name"</emphasis> to recall this declaration.  <emphasis remap='I'>built-in_command</emphasis>
specifies which command will be performed, taking its syntax from this
list of Built-In Commands/Functions. <emphasis remap='I'>"action"</emphasis> specifies the action
to take followed by any additional <emphasis remap='I'>arguments</emphasis> needed by the
<emphasis remap='I'>built-in_command</emphasis>. Menus can be specified by using the <emphasis remap='I'>Popup</emphasis>
command, as long as the menu was defined earlier in the configuration file.</para>

<para>The trigger <emphasis remap='I'>actions</emphasis> which are recognized are Immediate (can be
shortened to "I"), Motion, Click, DoubleClick and TripleClick. Immediate
actions are executed as soon as the function is activated, even if a window
has not been selected. If there are actions other than immediate ones,
<command>afterstep</command> will wait to see if the user is clicking, double-clicking,
triple-clicking or dragging the mouse; then will execute only the built-ins
from the function definition whose trigger action matches the action
performed by the user.  The clicking, double-clicking and triple-clicking
concepts do not carry through to using keyboard shortcuts.</para>

<para>Two special functions exist: InitFunction and RestartFunction. The
InitFunction will be called when <command>afterstep</command> is started for the first
time in any X session, and can be used to start modules and begin programs.
The RestartFunction will be called when <command>afterstep</command> is restarted. It can
be used to re-start modules but probably should not be used to start
programs.  These two functions are defined in the <emphasis remap='I'>autoexec</emphasis> file.</para>

<para>When calling a previously defined Function or a Function from a key-stroke
combination, Function is simply used as a built-in command using the
previously defined <emphasis remap='I'>"action"</emphasis> from the same <emphasis remap='I'>function_name</emphasis>.</para>
