<para>Specifies that <emphasis remap='I'>ModuleName</emphasis> should be spawned.</para>

<para>Currently, many modules are included with <command>afterstep</command>. <emphasis remap='B'>Wharf(1x)</emphasis>
and <emphasis remap='B'>Pager(1x)</emphasis> are two of the more popular ones. Wharf will normally
be spawned during initialization instead of in response to a mouse binding
or menu action. Modules can be short lived transient programs, or, like
Wharf, can be intended to remain for the duration of the X session.
Modules will be terminated by <command>afterstep</command> prior to restarts and quits,
if possible.</para>
