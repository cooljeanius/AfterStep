 <listitem>
    <para>Changes current desk to another desk as surmised from the arguments
    supplied.  If only <emphasis remap='I'>arg1</emphasis> is specified and is non-zero, then the
    current desk will become "desk + arg1" and <emphasis remap='I'>arg2</emphasis> is ignored.
    If <emphasis remap='I'>arg1</emphasis> is zero, then <emphasis remap='I'>arg2</emphasis> must be specified or no desk
    change will occur; and <emphasis remap='I'>arg2</emphasis> will specify the desk to switch to.
    Desk numbers are determined dynamically and must be between 2147483647
    and -2147483648; meaning they can also be negative.</para>
