 <term>WindowList [<emphasis remap='I'>arg1 arg2</emphasis>]</term>
 <listitem>
    <para>Specifies the internal popup menu in which the titles of each open
    application are displayed, should be popped up.  Selecting an item from the
    list will cause the current desk to switch to the application's desk, and
    will raise it if it's behind other windows.  If the application is currently
    iconified, then it will be de-iconified normally.</para>

    <para>Generally, if <emphasis remap='I'>arg1</emphasis> is an even number, then the windows will be listed
    using the window name (the name that shows up in the title-bar); if
    <emphasis remap='I'>arg1</emphasis> is an odd number, then the window's icon name is used.</para>

    <para>Specifically, if <emphasis remap='I'>arg1</emphasis> is 0, 1 or 2, then all windows on all desks
    will be shown.  If <emphasis remap='I'>arg1</emphasis> is 2 or 3, then only windows on the current
    desk will be shown.  If <emphasis remap='I'>arg1</emphasis> is 4 or 5, then only windows on the
    desk number specified with <emphasis remap='I'>arg2</emphasis>, will be shown.  Windows which have
    WindowListSkip specified in their style will not be listed in the window
    list.</para>
