 <listitem>
    <para>This is intended to be used in <command>afterstep</command> functions only. It causes
    execution of a function to pause until a new window named <emphasis remap='I'>app_name</emphasis>
    appears.  <command>afterstep</command> remains fully functional during a wait. This is
    particularly useful in the InitFunction and RestartFunction, if you are
    trying to start windows on specific desktops.</para>
