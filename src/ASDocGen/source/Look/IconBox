	<term>IconBox <emphasis remap='I'>left top right bottom</emphasis></term>
	<listitem>
		<para>Specifies a region of the screen in  which  to  place  iconified
		windows.  Up to four icon boxes can be defined. If an IconBox is
		provided, icons will automatically be placed in them, if  possible.
		Otherwise, they will be placed in the upper left corner of
		the screen. Each time a window is  iconified,  a  new  place  is
		found for it, unless the icon has been moved manually. An available
		space is searched for from left to right, then top to  bottom.
		Icons  will  not  be  automatically placed on top of other
		icons, but they may be placed underneath application windows  if
		StubbornIconPlacement  has  not been specified. If left or right
		is negative, then AfterStep will add the screen width to it.  If
		top  or  bottom  is negative, then AfterStep will add the screen
		height to it. Note that -0 is not parsed as the right or  bottom
		pixel  on  the screen. Use -1 instead. The IconBox will normally
		be filled from left to right, then top to bottom.   However,  if
		the right edge of the IconBox is closer to the right edge of the
		screen than the left edge of the IconBox is to the left edge  of
		the  screen,  then  it will be filled from right to left.  Similarly
		for top to bottom.  For example, "2 2 -1 -1"  will  result
		in  an  IconBox  which  fills from right to left, then bottom to
		top.</para>
