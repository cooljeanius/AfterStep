		<para>MenuPinOn is deprecated and AfterStep will reinterpret
                it, and it will create new TitleButton using last unused
                TitleButton context. It will then assign PinMenu function to
                this button. This button will only be shown on titlebars
                belonging to menu windows. This button behaves just like any
                other TitleButton - for example you can use TitleButtonOrder to
                specify where it should go. Problem is you may not know what
                context AfterStep had choosen for it. The better way would be
                to explicitely define TitleButton, and assign PinMenu to it in
                your feel.</para>
