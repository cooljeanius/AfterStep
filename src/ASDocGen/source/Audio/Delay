	<para>Specifies that sound events will only be played if they occur at
        least  so  many  seconds after the previous event.  Sound events
        that occur during the delay period are ignored.  This option  is
        useful  if  you  don't  want  several sounds playing at the same
        time.  The default delay is 0 which disables the audio delay.</para>
