		<para>Specifies  that  the  keyboard  input (aka focus) stays with one
		window until a new window's TitleBar is  clicked  on,  or  gains
		focus through Warping or de-iconification.</para>
<para>        AfterStep will not switch focus following mouse pointer, but instead will
        switch it when window is explicitely clicked. This is the same as before.
        The only difference is that AfterStep will not Raise window automagically,
        unless some other settings are set. Possible way to Raise window on
        focusing include:</para>
                <para>- set AutoRaise 0  in feel file ( delay of 0 )</para>
                <para>- bind mouse clicks to Raise or RaiseLower function in feel file.</para>
                <para>- set ClickToRaise flag in feel file.</para>
