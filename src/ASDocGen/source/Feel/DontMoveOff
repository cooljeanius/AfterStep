		<para>Specifies that windows should not  be  moved  off  or  initially
		placed  off  of  the desktop.  A few programs will not work cor-
		rectly if you use this option.  This  only  keeps  windows  from
		being completely lost off the edge of the desktop. It insists on
		keeping 16 pixels on the desktop, but does not attempt  to  keep
		the entire window on the desk.</para>
