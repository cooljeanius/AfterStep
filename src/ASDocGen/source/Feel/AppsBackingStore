		<para>Specifies that app windows should request backing store.
		X-terminals and low memory systems should avoid this as redrawing
		will be quicker than pulling the saved image  from  swap  space.
		Backing store will always be faster than redraw on machines that
		have enough memory. This causes non-ICCCM compliance.</para>
