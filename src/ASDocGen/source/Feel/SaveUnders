		<para>Specifies that afterstep frames should request saveunders.  This
		will cause afterstep to save those portions of windows that  are
		not  visible  to  system memory.  This can significantly improve
		the performance during opaque moves, but it causes a significant
		increase  in  memory usage.  This can also cause garbled display
		with some applications.</para>
