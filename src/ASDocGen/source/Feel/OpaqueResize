		<para>Specifies  the  maximum size window where opaque resizing should
		be used.  % is percent of the total screen area.  Set to 0,  all
		windows  will  be resized using the traditional rubber-band out-
		line.  Set to 100, all windows will be resized as solid windows.
		The  default is 5 which allows small windows to be resized in an
		opaque manner, but large windows to be resized as  rubber-bands.
		Using this option with large values can slow down video response
		on slower systems.</para>
