		<para> Specifies how hard it should be to change views within a desktop
		by moving the mouse over the edge of the screen, and how hard it
		hould be to move a window over the edge of a screen.
</para><para>
		The  delay  in  milliseconds,  defines how long the pointer must
		spend at the screen edge before that view becomes current.  This
		is  useful  in conjunction with EdgeScroll 100 100, so the views
		don't get switched accidently.
</para><para>
		The pixels defines how far over the edge a window must  "appear"
		to move before it actually moves partially off the screen.
</para><para>
		Note  that  with EdgeScroll 0 0, it is still possible to move or
		resize windows across the edge of the current screen. By setting
		the  pixels  parameter  of EdgeResistance to 10000, this type of
		motion is impossible. However, with  EdgeResistances  less  than
		10000,  but  greater than 0, moving over pages becomes difficult
		but not impossible.</para>
