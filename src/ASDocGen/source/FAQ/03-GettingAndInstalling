<section><title>3.2. What do I need to compile and install AfterStep?</title>
<para>
Because AfterStep is an X application, you need to have X installed, and the X development
libraries (note, in this case "development" means libraries need to compile things with X,
not development level code).  It's probably a good idea to also have a working C compiler.
</para><para>
AfterStep includes some image libraries, but it is recommended that you install those libraries 
using your distribution's package management system. Note that you will need development libraries 
in addition to run-time libraries. The following are the libraries that AfterStep can take advantage of : 
<variablelist>
<varlistentry><listitem><para>libJPEG - support for JPEG image format</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><listitem><para>libPNG - support for PNG image format</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><listitem><para>libTIFF - support for TIFF image format</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><listitem><para>Freetype - support for TrueType fonts</para></listitem></varlistentry>
</variablelist>
</para><para>
Note that following image format do not require any external libraries :

<section><title>3.3. Can I install AfterStep without being root?</title>
<para>
Yes, before compiling AfterStep, do this:
<literallayout><code>mkdir &tilde;/bin
mkdir -p &tilde;/man/man1
./configure --prefix &tilde;/
</code></literallayout>
Then follow the normal install directions, allowing you to <code>make install</code> without being
root.

<section><title>3.4. How do I upgrade AfterStep from AfterStep version prior to 2.0.0?</title>
<para>
Install AfterStep 2.0 and then run it. It will start with default configuration that you may or maynot like.
If you wish to try and reuse your old configuration files, then copy them over from your old 
&tilde;/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/ directory and into &tilde;/.afterstep/. 
Restart AfterStep to make changes effective. If some of the features do not work quite right - 
feel free to submit bug report along with your configuration files.
</para><para>
It is recommended though that you start with default configuration and try out all of the supplied looks and color schemes.
Select whichever is close to what you want and then modify it to your liking. 
These approach will allow you to take advantage of many new features, available in AfterStep 2.0.

<section><title>3.4. How do I upgrade AfterStep from AfterStep version higher then 2.0.0?</title>
<para>
Make sure that all configuration files that you ever changed are in your home directory at &tilde;/.afterstep/, as
installing afterstep will replace everything in global shared location (/usr/local/share/afterstep).
Install afterstep and run. You should not have any trouble.
</para>

<section><title>3.5. What's up with all these compile errors?</title>
<para>
Most likely, you don't have the X devel package (should have come with
your operating system, if not, check <ulink url="http://www.x.org/">http://www.x.org/</ulink>).
</para>
</section>

<section><title>3.6. How the hell does one configure AfterStep?</title>
<para>
Configuration files are usually either in /usr(/local)/share/afterstep for
system wide configuration and ~.afterstep for personal settings.
</para>
<para>
Configuration is handled in multiple files:
look file (in looks subdirectory) for visual attributes, feel file (in feels
subdirectory) for the general behaviour; wharf, winlist, banner, pager, animate
for module specific configuration.
</para>
<para>
Just copy any file you want to modify over from /usr(/local)/share/afterstep to
~.afterstep to override system wide defaults retaining subdirectory layout.
