<term>Window frame decorations (aka MyFrame)</term>
<para>Each window is surrounded by so-called frame decoration. each
frame decoration could be built from 9 TBars:</para>
               <para>1) Main Titlebar  with icons on left, label in the middle and
                   icons on right. Label may also have special underlying image -
                   so called Title Background. Ordering of this elements is set by
                   TitleButtonOrder setting ( see below ).</para>
                <para>2) 4 frame sides. Each of this have fixed width that is
                   determined by SideSize setting  or image size if SideSize is
                   ommited. Second dimension of the TBar changes to match the
                   size of the window.</para>
                <para>3) 4 frame corners. Each of this have both fixed width and
                   height, as determined by CornerSize setting or image size.</para>

                   <para>Each of above elements is rendered by generating background
                using respective MyStyle, and then overlaying images/buttons
                and text on top of it. Default overlaying is done using
                composition method alpha-blend. In case of main Titlebar that
                could be changed. Bevel is then drawn on top of the image as
                specified in respective setting.</para>



<para>  MyFrame allows different MyStyles to be used for titlebar and
                frame decorations. If any of those are ommited - default
                setting from FWindowStyle/UWindowStyle/SWindowStyle will be
                used.</para>

<para>                   Important:
                        If you use semi-transparent images for frame sides -
                they will be overlayed on top of MyStyle generated background,
                so if you want it to be overlayed over root background - you
                should use MyStyle with BackPixmap set to 129 or 149.</para>
<para>                        Also note that unless you use MYStyle with BackPixmap
                126 and 125 - frame decorations will not be shaped. Likewise if
                you want frame part to have only the shape of the image, you
                specified, with no background at all - use MyStyle with
                BackPixmap set like so :</para>

<para>                 BackPixmap  126  empty.xpm</para>

<para>                Where empty.xpm is 1x1 completely transparent image (supplied
                as desktop/icons/common/empty.xpm ).</para>

<para>                   To identify side/corner it is possible to use abbreviations,
                such as: N, NW, SW, etc.</para>
<para>                   All the CompositionMethod settings must have one of the
                BackPixmap types from MyStyles ( ie 130-143 )</para>
<para>                   Align setting may have different meaning/capabilities for
                different items. When applied to text - it simply aligns text
                to sides mentioned. When applied to image - such as title
                background or frame side pixmap - it also specifies if image
                should be tiled, scaled or left same size. Make sure that you
                use HTiled,VTiled or HScaled,VScaled for frame sides -
                otherwise images on they will not be resized to match window
                size (this is also a feature :).</para>
                  <para>To center item specify Align to include both sides. For
                example : </para>

                   <para>Align Left,Right</para>

<para>                   will center item horizontally.</para>

<para>                Note that TitleBackground option allows you to specify an
                image to be used under titlebar label in addition to the MyStyle.
                This was done for better shaped titlebars. You may have MyStyle
                to be completely transparent shape, while TitleBackground some
                non-transparent image, and that will provide better visibility
                for the titlebar text.</para>
